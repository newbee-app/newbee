# tailwind-preset

This lib is an extremely minimal shell to house the global tailwid config meant to be shared across all frontend projects. It resides outside of the `newbee` dir in case we create other frontend projects that will also use Tailwind. Making it its own lib offers the benefit of refreshing any currently served projects if changes are made to the tailwind config.
