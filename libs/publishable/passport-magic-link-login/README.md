# publishable-passport-magic-link-login

This lib contains an implementation of a magic link login authentication strategy usable through the Nest Passport module.

## Why this lib was created

Although an open source implementation of a magic link type of strategy already exists for Passport, the way it was structured was geared more towards use with `Express` and was not easy to set up with Nest's Passport module. As a result, this lib was created to meet our specific use cases.

## Publishing the lib

While this lib is not yet published anywhere, it is a candidate for open-sourcing. One day, we do plan on making this available as an open source project, but there's no rush.
