# oriz

Strongly influenced by the [CASL library](https://github.com/stalniy/casl). This library was created to allow for a permissions structure similar to CASL that was a bit more intuitive to use and relied on callbacks rather than MQL (MongoDB Query Language). It's called `oriz` because of the word `authorization`, and the fact that `oriz` is the only part of the word that differentiates it from `authentication`, a similar but distinct concept in computer science.
